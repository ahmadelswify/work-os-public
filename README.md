# work-os: AI-Native Productivity for Any Professional

A simple, powerful system for managing your work using AI. No apps, no forms, just conversations with your AI assistant.

## Why work-os?

Most productivity tools force you into rigid structures: fill out forms, click through interfaces, manually organize tasks. **work-os flips this around** — you brain dump naturally, and AI structures everything for you.

**Works for any professional:**
- **Content Creators** — script management, feedback tracking, content performance
- **Professors & Educators** — course planning, research tracking, student advising
- **Operations Managers** — process improvement, vendor management, incident tracking
- **Customer Success** — account management, renewals, customer health
- **Marketing** — campaigns, content calendars, launch coordination
- **Product Managers** — roadmaps, cross-functional coordination
- **Freelancers & Entrepreneurs** — client work, business development
- **Anyone** who wants AI to handle organization while they handle work

## How It Works

1. **Brain dump** into BACKLOG.md throughout your day
2. **Say "process backlog"** to your AI assistant
3. **AI organizes everything** into structured tasks, projects, and priorities
4. **Work naturally** by asking "what should I work on today?"

That's it. No manual categorization, no form-filling, no app-switching.

## Why I Built This

I tried Notion. I tried Todoist. I even tried GTD, bullet journaling, and every productivity "system" out there.

**The pattern was always the same**: Week 1, excited. Week 2, customizing. Week 3, spending more time organizing than working. Week 4, back to scattered notes.

**The irony**: Productivity systems became my biggest productivity drain.

**The key insight**: Let AI handle the system while you handle the work. Brain dump. AI organizes. You keep working.

No setup overhead. No maintenance burden. No productivity theater.

## Quick Start

### Simple Setup (No Git Required) — 2 minutes

Don't know Git? No problem.

1. **Download** — Click the green "Code" button above, then "Download ZIP"
2. **Extract** — Unzip to a folder (Documents/work-os works great)
3. **Open with AI** — Open the folder with Claude, ChatGPT, or your AI assistant
4. **Say:** `"Help me set up work-os"`

That's it! AI asks about your role, creates your personalized structure, and you're ready to start.

### Advanced Setup (With Git) — 5 minutes

Benefits: Version history, backup to GitHub, sync across devices.

1. **Clone:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/work-os.git
   ```
2. **Open with Claude Code** (or your AI assistant)
3. **Say:** `"Help me set up work-os"`

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed setup options.

## Daily Workflow

**First Time Setup:**
```
"Help me set up work-os"
```
AI asks about your role and configures everything for you.

**Morning:**
```
"What should I work on today?"
```
AI reviews your tasks and goals to suggest priorities.

**During Work:**
```
"Add to backlog: Follow up with Sarah about the renewal"
"Add to backlog: Draft script for next week's video"
"Add to backlog: Review the vendor contract"
```

**End of Day:**
```
"Process my backlog"
```
AI organizes everything into tasks with priorities and context.

**Weekly:**
```
"Weekly review"
```
AI helps you reflect, track progress, and plan ahead.

## Directory Structure

Your structure adapts to your role. Here's the base:

```
work-os/
├── BACKLOG.md           # Your brain dump inbox
├── GOALS.md             # Your objectives
├── Active/              # Current work (organized by YOUR categories)
├── Projects/            # Multi-task initiatives
├── Career/              # Professional development
│   ├── accomplishments.md
│   ├── 1-on-1s/
│   └── portfolio/
├── Knowledge/           # Reference materials (optional)
└── Archive/             # Completed work (optional)
```

The `Active/` folder structure is personalized during setup based on your role.

## Example Conversation

```
You: "Add to backlog: Client wants to discuss expanding the project scope,
      need to prep talking points for Thursday"

You: "Process backlog"

AI: Created task: 'Prep talking points for client scope discussion'
    - Marked as important (meeting Thursday)
    - Category: client-work
    - Connected to: Q1 expansion goal

You: "What should I work on today?"

AI: Here's your focus for today:

    Urgent:
    • Prep talking points for client scope discussion (Thursday meeting)
    • Finish the draft proposal (client waiting)

    If you have time:
    • Review last month's project metrics

    You're in good shape — two things need attention today.

You: "Done with the client prep"

AI: Nice! Marked as done.
    That meeting could be portfolio-worthy if the scope expands —
    want me to track it?
```

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need a specific AI assistant?**
A: Works with Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI that can read files. Claude Code is recommended for the best experience.

**Q: Is this overkill for my work?**
A: No! Use only what you need. Just BACKLOG.md + AI is already valuable.

**Q: How is this different from Notion/Asana/Jira?**
A: Those require manual input and learning curves. work-os is conversational — brain dump, AI organizes.

**Q: Can I customize the structure?**
A: Absolutely! It's just markdown files. Reorganize however you want.

**Q: Do I need to know Git?**
A: No. Download the ZIP and use it with any folder. Git is optional for version history.

**Q: What about personal tasks?**
A: This is designed for professional work. For personal life, consider a separate system.

**Q: Will my data stay private?**
A: Yes. It's just files on your computer. Nothing is uploaded unless you choose to back up to GitHub.
