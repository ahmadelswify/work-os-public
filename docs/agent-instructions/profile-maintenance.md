# Profile Maintenance

When and how to update the user's profile.

## Profile Location

`Knowledge/profile.md` — The user's professional background, skills, values, and career narrative.

## When to Suggest Updates

Suggest a profile update when you observe:

| Trigger | What to Update |
|---------|---------------|
| New job role begins | Title, company, responsibilities |
| Major project completes | Projects section, skills demonstrated |
| Significant life change | Personal context (if user shares) |
| New skill demonstrated | Skills section |
| Key relationship milestone | Professional network |
| Major event attended | Insights, connections made |
| Quarterly review | Overall refresh |

## How to Update

1. **Ask first:** "Should I update your profile with this information?"
2. Never update silently — the profile belongs to the user
3. Propose specific changes, not vague "I'll update your profile"
4. Preserve existing content — add to sections, don't rewrite

## What the Profile Contains

- Professional summary and narrative
- Current role and responsibilities
- Skills and capabilities
- Education and certifications
- Key projects and accomplishments
- Values and philosophy
- Career goals and direction

## Using the Profile

Reference the profile when:
- Tailoring resumes or cover letters
- Writing content in the user's voice
- Recommending career development tasks
- Providing context for goal alignment
