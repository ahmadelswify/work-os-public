# Categories & Priority Framework

## Default Categories

These are starting suggestions. During setup, the agent creates categories based on the user's actual work.

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| projects | Strategic initiatives, multi-step work |
| meetings | Prep, follow-ups, action items |
| outreach | Follow-ups, networking, relationship building |
| writing | Content, docs, emails, reports |
| research | Analysis, learning, discovery |
| admin | Operations, finance, logistics |
| ideas | Someday/maybe, brainstorms |

## Role-Specific Categories

During setup, ask the user about their role and create appropriate Active/ categories:

**Content Creator:** scripts, production, published, ideas, partnerships
**Professor:** research, teaching, students, service, grants
**Operations Manager:** processes, vendors, incidents, projects, reporting
**Support Specialist:** escalations, follow-ups, knowledge-base, training, meetings
**Marketing:** campaigns, content, launches, analytics, partnerships
**Customer Success:** accounts, renewals, escalations, projects, onboarding
**General Professional:** projects, meetings, follow-ups, ideas, admin

Adapt to what the user actually tells you.

## Priority Framework

| Level | Code | User Language | Meaning | Review Cadence |
|-------|------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| Critical | P0 | "urgent" | Must do this week | Daily |
| Important | P1 | "important" | This month | Weekly |
| Backlog | P2 | "scheduled" | On the radar | Biweekly |
| Someday | P3 | "idea" | Maybe later | Monthly/quarterly |

## Role-Specific Urgency

What counts as "urgent" varies by role:
- **Support:** Customer down, SLA breach imminent
- **Content Creator:** Publishing deadline, brand partnership deadline
- **Professor:** Grant deadline, class tomorrow, grade submission
- **Operations:** Incident, SLA breach, vendor deadline
- **Marketing:** Campaign launch, event deadline

When unsure, ask: "Is this blocking something or does it have a hard deadline this week?"

## Role Adaptation During Setup

Ask these questions conversationally (not as a form):

1. "What's your role?" — Understand their professional context
2. "What types of work fill your day?" — Learn their task categories
3. "What makes something urgent for you?" — Calibrate priority framework
4. "What do you want to spend less time organizing?" — Understand pain points

Based on answers, create Active/ subdirectories matching their work categories.
