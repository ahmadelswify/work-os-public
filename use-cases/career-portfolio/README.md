# Customer Health Dashboard

*A data-driven approach to reducing churn through proactive customer management*

## Overview
Built an automated customer health scoring system that reduced churn by 15% and enabled proactive account management for 200+ customers.

## The Problem
- Customer Success team was reactive, only engaging when customers complained
- No visibility into which customers were at risk
- Churn was 22% annually (industry avg: 18%)
- Team spent time on wrong accounts while high-value customers churned

## The Solution
Created SQL-based dashboard in BI tool (Tableau/Looker/Sigma) that:
- Aggregates 12 health signals (product usage, support tickets, NPS, engagement)
- Calculates risk scores updated daily
- Prioritizes accounts needing attention
- Tracks trends over time

## My Role
- **Research:** Interviewed 10 CSMs and analyzed churned customers to identify signals
- **Technical:** Wrote SQL queries pulling data from 4 systems (CRM, support ticketing, product analytics, NPS)
- **Design:** Designed dashboard UX with input from team
- **Implementation:** Built and tested in BI platform
- **Rollout:** Trained team, created documentation, established weekly review process

## Impact

**Quantitative:**
- 15% churn reduction in first quarter
- ~$2M ARR saved
- 2 hours/week saved per CSM (automated manual analysis)
- 10 CSMs using daily

**Qualitative:**
- Team shifted from reactive to proactive
- Higher confidence in prioritization
- Earlier customer interventions (avg 4 weeks sooner)
- Cross-functional adoption (Product and Support teams now use it)

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Technical:** SQL, data visualization, systems integration
- **Product:** User research, UX design, documentation
- **Leadership:** Cross-functional collaboration, change management, training
- **Business:** ROI analysis, metrics definition, strategic thinking

## Stakeholders

### LinkedIn Update
```
You: "Create a LinkedIn post about my customer health dashboard"

AI: Here's a draft:

🎯 How we reduced customer churn by 15%

Like many Customer Success teams, we were reactive - waiting for customers to tell us they had problems.

The insight: We had all the data we needed, but no way to see it holistically.

I built a customer health dashboard that:
✅ Tracks 12 health signals across 200+ accounts
✅ Flags at-risk customers automatically
✅ Updates daily so we can intervene early

Results in first quarter:
📉 15% churn reduction (~$2M ARR saved)
⏰ 2 hours/week saved per CSM
📈 Team confidence in prioritization way up

The key: Moving from gut feel to data-driven customer management.

Now it's our company standard. Sometimes the best tools are the ones you build for yourself.
