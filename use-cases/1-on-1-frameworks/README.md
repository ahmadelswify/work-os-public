# 1:1 Meeting Frameworks

Make your 1:1s with your manager more valuable by tracking ongoing threads, accomplishments, and career discussions.

## The Problem

Most people go into 1:1s and wing it:
- Forget what you wanted to discuss
- Don't track commitments from last time
- Miss opportunities to highlight accomplishments
- No record for performance reviews

## The Solution

Keep a running 1:1 document that AI helps you maintain between meetings.

## Framework

### Before Meeting: Prepare
```
You: "1:1 with Sarah tomorrow, help me prepare"

AI: Here's what to discuss based on your recent work:

Accomplishments to share:
- Closed Customer X renewal (2-year, $500K)
- Launched new onboarding flow (20% faster)

Topics from last time:
- Q1 goal setting (you had action items)
- Training budget discussion (pending)

Suggested agenda:
1. Share recent wins
2. Follow up on Q1 goals
3. Discuss upcoming project priorities
4. Ask about training budget
```

### During Meeting: Take Notes
Brain dump into your 1:1 file or BACKLOG.md:
```
- Sarah loved the renewal story
- Q1 goal: increase NRR by 10%
- She wants me to lead customer advisory board
- Training budget approved - find courses by next week
- Talked about promotion criteria
```

### After Meeting: Process
```
You: "Process my 1:1 notes with Sarah"

AI: Created tasks:
- [P1] Research customer advisory board best practices
- [P1] Find 3 courses for training budget (due: next week)
- [P2] Document promotion criteria discussion

Updated Career/1-on-1s/sarah-manager.md with:
- New action items
- Q1 goal tracking
- Promotion discussion notes
```

## Tips

1. **Be consistent**: Update after every 1:1
2. **Track accomplishments**: Share wins regularly, not just at review time
3. **Follow through**: AI will remind you of open action items
4. **Archive quarterly**: Keep document focused on recent/current topics
5. **Use for multiple relationships**: Works for skip-levels, mentors, direct reports

## Getting Started

1. Create `Career/1-on-1s/` directory
2. Create a file for your manager (or use the template below)
3. Before your next 1:1, say: "Help me prepare for my 1:1 with [name]"
4. After the meeting, brain dump notes and say: "Process my 1:1 notes"

## Template

See [1-on-1-template.md](1-on-1-template.md) for a ready-to-use template.

**Pro tip**: This same framework works for skip-level 1:1s, mentor relationships, and even managing your own direct reports!
