# work-os for Any Professional

A flexible guide for using work-os in any professional role.

## Why work-os Works for Everyone

No matter your role, you're likely dealing with:
- Multiple projects and priorities
- Meetings and stakeholder communication
- Career development and growth
- The need to demonstrate impact

work-os adapts to your specific work, not the other way around.

## Universal Setup

### 1. Define Your Goals (GOALS.md)
```markdown
# 2026 Q1 Goals

## Professional Goals
- [Your main work objective]
- [Secondary objective]
- [Career/learning goal]

## Key Results
- [Measurable outcome 1]
- [Measurable outcome 2]

## Focus Areas
- [What you're prioritizing]
```

### 2. Set Up Your Work Categories

Customize `Active/` to match YOUR work:

**Common structures:**

**For Project Managers:**
```
Active/
├── projects/
├── stakeholder-management/
├── planning/
├── meetings/
└── reporting/
```

**For Sales Professionals:**
```
Active/
├── deals/
├── prospecting/
├── customer-meetings/
├── proposals/
└── pipeline-management/
```

**For Operations Roles:**
```
Active/
├── process-improvement/
├── vendor-management/
├── incidents/
├── planning/
└── reporting/
```

**For Analysts:**
```
Active/
├── analysis/
├── reporting/
├── requests/
├── projects/
└── learning/
```

**The key:** Match your directory structure to your actual work categories.

## Universal Workflows

### The Morning Question
```
You: "What should I work on today?"

AI: Based on your tasks and goals:

🔴 Urgent:
- [Deadline today or blocking others]

🟡 Important:
- [Committed work for this week/month]

⚡ Quick wins:
- [Small tasks that create value]

Aligned with your goal: [relevant goal from GOALS.md]
```

### The Brain Dump Habit
Throughout your day, capture everything in BACKLOG.md:
```
- Great conversation with stakeholder X, they want feature Y
- Noticed process inefficiency in workflow Z
- Need to follow up on last week's proposal
- Idea: create dashboard for team metrics
- Research needed: best practices for [topic]
```

**The rule:** Capture first, organize later.

### The Daily Processing
```
You: "Process my backlog"

AI: [Reads your brain dump]
    [Checks your goals and current projects]
    [Creates organized tasks with priorities]
    [Asks clarifying questions if needed]
    [Clears your backlog]
```

### The Weekly Review
```
You: "Weekly review"

AI: This week you:

Accomplished:
- ✅ [completed tasks]

Projects progressed:
- [project status updates]

Goals:
- [progress toward goals]

Next week priorities:
- [suggested focus areas]
```

## Adapting to Your Role

### Just Tell Claude About Your Work

No manual setup required. Just describe what you do:

```
You: "I'm a [your role]. My main work involves [category 1], [category 2],
     and [category 3]. Urgent things for me are [what's urgent].
     Right now I'm focused on [current priorities]."

Claude: "I'll set up your workspace based on your work..."
```

Claude will:
1. Create `Active/` folders that match your actual work categories
2. Set up your GOALS.md with your priorities
3. Learn what "urgent" means for YOUR role
4. Adapt the system to how YOU work

**No forms. No manual folder creation. Just conversation.**
