## Pro Tips Conversations

### Getting Unstuck
```
You: "I feel overwhelmed, help me prioritize"

AI: "Let's get you focused. Looking at your tasks:

You have:
- 8 P0 tasks (this is too many!)
- 12 P1 tasks
- 20 P2 tasks

Let's be honest about priorities:

TRUE P0 (must do this week):
- Customer X renewal meeting (tomorrow) ✅ legit urgent
- Support escalation for Customer Y ✅ blocking customer

PROBABLY P1 (not truly urgent):
- Draft blog post → P1 (has a due date but not this week)
- Update metrics dashboard → P2 (nice to have)
- 4 other items → Let's review

Can you identify which of your 'P0s' are truly blocking or have hard deadlines THIS WEEK?

Once we right-size your P0 list (goal: 2-3 items), you'll feel more in control."
```

### Finding Time for Career Development
```
You: "I want to learn SQL but I'm too busy"

AI: "Let's make this happen. Looking at your goals, SQL supports your customer analytics objective.

Strategy:
- SQL learning time = investment, not 'extra work'
- Start small: 30 min/day, specific projects

Practical approach:
1. Create task: [P2] Complete SQL basics (30 min/day)
2. Link to real work: Use it to build your dashboard
3. Track in Career/professional-development/

Your dashboard project is the perfect practice ground. Instead of 'finding time to learn SQL,' you're 'using SQL to build your dashboard.'

Want me to add this to your active work?"
